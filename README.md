# Agile Travel — Flight Booking (Manual QA Project)

Project type: Manual testing / Test management demonstration
Author: Soumya Hegde
Summary: This repository demonstrates a complete manual testing cycle for an Agile travel (flight booking) web application. It contains test cases, defects, execution reports, and screenshots produced using Jira + Zephyr Scale.

# Quick summary

* Created 35 test cases in Zephyr Scale (manual test coverage for the Flight Booking workflow).
* Logged ~20 defects in Jira with attachments and triage history.
* Generated test cycle & execution reports (PDF) and captured screenshots illustrating board, workflow, and execution status.

# the Repo consists

* Defects/Jira.docx — contains exported defects or a consolidated defect report.
* Reports/ — final exported PDF reports from Zephyr/Jira showing test cycle metrics and bug dashboard.
* Screenshots/ — visual proof of board setup, test cycles, and test executions (useful for interviews).
* TestCases/ — individual Excel files with detailed manual test steps, preconditions, expected results, test data, and status.

# How to open / view files

1. PDF reports: open with any PDF viewer (Adobe Reader, browser).
2. Excel testcases (.xlsx): open in MS Excel or Google Sheets (recommended to preserve formatting).
3. Screenshots: open in image viewer or just preview in GitHub (they render in the repo).
4. Jira.docx: open with MS Word or Google Docs.

# What I  approach

* Test scope: Flight booking workflow (search, select, passenger details, payment, booking confirmation).
* Test case design: Positive and negative test cases (boundary conditions, invalid inputs, UI/functional checks, payment validations).
* Test management: Used Zephyr Scale for creating test cases, grouping into test cycles, executing tests, and exporting results.
* Defect reporting: Logged defects in Jira with steps to reproduce, severity/priority, and screenshots. Produced a consolidated defects document in Defects/.
* Reports & evidence: Exported test cycle & execution reports from Zephyr/Jira to Reports/ and captured screenshots for process/workflow evidence.
