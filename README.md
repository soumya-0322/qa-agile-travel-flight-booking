# 🚀 Summary

This repository demonstrates a complete **manual testing cycle** for the Agile Travel – Flight Booking web application. It includes test case design, defect reporting, test execution, and evidence generated using **Jira + Zephyr Scale**.
**Created 35 test cases in Zephyr Scale**(manual test coverage for the Flight Booking workflow).
**Logged ~20 defects in Jira** with attachments and triage history.
**Generated test cycle & execution reports** and captured screenshots illustrating board, workflow, and execution status.
